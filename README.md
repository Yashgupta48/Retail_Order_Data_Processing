## ðŸ§¾ SQL Business Insight Queries

 **File**: `sql_code.sql`

This file contains SQL queries that answer real business questions:

###  1. Top 10 Revenue-Generating Products

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 product_id, SUM(sale_price) AS sales
FROM df_orders
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY sales DESC;
```

###  2. Top 5 Best-Selling Products by Region

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT region, product_id, SUM(sale_price) AS sales
    FROM df_orders
    GROUP BY region, product_id
)
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sales DESC) AS rn
    FROM cte
) A
WHERE rn <= 5;
```

###  3. Month-over-Month Sales Growth (2022 vs 2023)

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT YEAR(order_date) AS order_year, MONTH(order_date) AS order_month,
           SUM(sale_price) AS sales
    FROM df_orders
    GROUP BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date)
)
SELECT order_month,
       SUM(CASE WHEN order_year = 2022 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_2022,
       SUM(CASE WHEN order_year = 2023 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_2023
FROM cte
GROUP BY order_month;
```

##  Insights & Conclusions

-  **Concentration of Sales**: A small set of products contributes to the majority of revenue.
-  **Seasonal Trends**: Sales peak during certain months, which helps in planning marketing campaigns.
-  **Regional Preferences**: Different regions prefer different product types â€“ useful for inventory planning.
-  **Year-over-Year Comparison**: 2023 saw a growth in sales compared to 2022 in most months.
